Today we'll be writing our first javascript code.I hope you have a folder for your learning progress. Create a new file called index.js <br/></br>
 **Note :** The file must have a .js extension indicating that it's a javascript file </br>
 </br>
 In the file, paste this code

```javaScript
// print anything on the terminal
console.log("hello word")
console.log(1)

```
Open a new terminal in vsCode and write paste this then enter.This will run your code or use the play button at the top right hand side of vsCode's toolBar.

```sh
node index.js
```
